 * them: one writer, one reader, no lock and nothing allocated after it's made (the device's thread must never wait).
 * Stereo frames, a left and a right sample each. A frame that doesn't fit is dropped; a read past what's there is
 * silence. [capacityFrames] is a power of two, so the counts may wrap.
